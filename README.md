# What is OpenCV?
OpenCV is an open-source library for computer vision, with a focus on real-time applications. It focuses mainly on video capture/processing, image processing, and analysis (like face and object detection). It has many built-in functions and pre-trained models, so we donâ€™t have to worry about training and testing of algorithms.
